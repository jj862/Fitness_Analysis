Fitness Analysis and Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a Kaggle notebook that performs data analysis and applies machine learning models to a fitness survey dataset. The goal is to predict two key aspects of fitness habits:

Health Self-Assessment: Predict how healthy a person considers themselves based on their exercise habits, fitness levels, and motivations.
Active Status: Predict whether a person exercises alone, with a group, or not at all, based on their fitness level and barriers to exercise.
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and transformed, with categorical data encoded and text columns processed using TF-IDF.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations of key trends and distributions, such as exercise importance, fitness levels, and health self-assessments.
Machine Learning Models:
Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting models are applied to predict health self-assessment and active status.
Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are used to improve model performance.
Handling Imbalanced Data: SMOTE is used to balance the dataset for better model generalization.
